# 🕵️ Subdomain Enumeration – Passive Recon Project

This project is a full scaffold for **safe and passive** subdomain enumeration of a target domain.  
It includes collectors (like Certificate Transparency logs and GitHub mentions), normalization tools, enrichment scripts (like ASN/IP lookups), and Markdown report generation.

> ⚠️ **Only use this project on targets you are authorized to test.**  
> Unauthorized scanning is illegal and unethical.
